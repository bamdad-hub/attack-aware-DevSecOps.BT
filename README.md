# attack-aware-DevSecOps

An attack-aware DevSecOps platform that enforces security from CI to runtime,
and continuously evolves policies based on real attack behavior.

## Key Concepts
- Security as Code
- Shift-Left and Shift-Right Security
- Runtime Attack Detection
- Automated Security Feedback Loop

## Project Phases
1. CI/CD Security Pipeline
2. Reverse Proxy Security
3. Honeypot & Attack Capture
4. Policy Feedback Loop

> This project is built as a learning and demonstration platform for
> real-world DevSecOps and cloud security practices.
